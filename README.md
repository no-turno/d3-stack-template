# D3 Stack

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, [@elysiajs/eden](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview.html) as RPC client for API requests.

> This stack is built using [`bun.js`](https://bun.sh/docs) as runtime and [`elysia`](https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html) as web-api framework. Bundle is handled by [`vite.js`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). The routing is provided by [`@tanstack/react-router`](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)
